# Extended-Windowing-Semantics
Overview:
Due to the advance of the stream processing systems and the diversity of their semantics, this research is initiated. The aim is to evaluate the internal windowing semantics of those systems.

What is inside?
This repository is associated with the paper “WiTeREvR: A Modern Look on Stream Processing Engines Windowing Semantics”.
WiTeREvR is a proposed model to evaluate windowing semantics of the modern stream processing engines. 
In this repository there are two folders:
1- Simulator, in which one can find the java source for the WiTeREvR model simulator.
2- Experiments, in which there is a subfolder for the source code and experimental results for each system of the systems under the test. 
In this table below the engines and their tested versions:
SPE	Version
Beam 	2.6.0
Flink	1.6.0
Spark	2.3.1
Storm	1.2.0
Kafka Streaming	2.0.0
